# Wizard-Game-C-
Using classes, I created a wizard game that randomizes the amount of spellpoints a player gets. The more spellpoints the more spells, and the more chance to get higher exp, which is the goal of this game. this game goes into depth with classes and shows my understanding not only of classes but of variables and how to manipulate code.
